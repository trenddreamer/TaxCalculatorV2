# TaxCalculator
Welcome to my Tax Calculator App

This project consists of a simple user interface and a Web Api as backend. 

You can test the API via swagger on the backend with integrated Bearer Token Authentication.
My Authentication was not created via scaffolding and is intended to be pretty basic, no frills.

A Default User is created for you with username: admin and password: admin
I have a BaseUrl class in TaxCalculator.Web which stores the APIBaseURL
